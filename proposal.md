## Proposal: Shirt Factory

### Justin Epperly - PDXCodeGuild

**Shirt Factory** is a web app that allows users to upload an image, transform that image to ASCII art, and render the transformed artwork as an image on a shirt.

The ASCII art image is a rendering of the original image using only alpha/numeric characters.

## Specific Functionality

1. Main page with ASCII art generator
2. Page for each finished design
3. Gallery of submitted designs

#### Home page

  * Shirt design section displays blank white shirt initially with an input form for the image file to be transformed

  * Form input for specifying a name for the design

  * Page will have a menu linking to design gallery

#### Shirt page (order form page)

  * Displays final shirt image and name

  * Links to home page

#### Design gallery page

  * Displays all shirt designs with titles

  * Links to home page

## Data Model

### User Input Image

  - Unique ID
  - Image file uploaded by user

### Shirt Image

  - Unique ID
  - UID of original image
  - timestamp of creation
  - shirt title
  - processed ASCII image
  - finished shirt - processed image on blank shirt

## Technical Components

- ASCII art converter - converts image to grayscale then applies grid and substitutes alpha/numberic characters for image color in each grid returning a "ascii art" version of image
    * uses existing modules: pillow, PIL, numpy and module from 'Python playground'
    * link: https://github.com/electronut/pp/tree/master/ascii

- Django for managing web interactions

- Pages will be generated by django templates using HTML and styled with css

- Images from user and finished images from the ASCII converter will be transferred using UID

### Timeline
Date                 | Stage
-------------------- | --------------------
Week 1: 5/2  - 5/6   | *Stage 1 & 2*

####Stages

1. Make test page and initialize django database
  **Week 1**

2. Make test module for data transformation
  * Install django
  * Set up basic test page
  **Week 1 & 2**

3. Make shirt database and connect to functioning test module and page.
  * Begin testing ASCII art generator
  **Week 2 & 3**

4. Create and style site pages
  * home
  * finished shirt page
  * gallery page
  **Week 3 & 4**

5. Connect and test gallery and shirt page
  **Week 4 & 5**

6. Refine design and Set up order processing
  - Finished MVP but continuing refinements
  **Week 5**

7. Add other design generators
    * Oregon Trail and glitch modules
    * Investigate full shirt designer interface
      - Mostly outside of project scope...this is something that gives user an end point
      - Clicking on shirt in gallery takes user to order form for shirt
  **Week 5**

## Further Work
* Options for selecting color of shirt and color of print
* Shirt image page will have order form linking to Paypal so any user can order any shirt
* Add user login
* Add user page which shows all designs by user
* Pretty user interface
* Add other generators, ex: Oregon Trail and glitch
